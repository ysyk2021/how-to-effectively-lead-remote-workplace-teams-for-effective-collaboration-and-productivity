Remote teams may face unexpected changes, such as new project requirements, team member turnover, or technological challenges. Leaders must be prepared to adapt quickly to these changes and provide support to their team members throughout the process.

Leaders can promote adaptability by setting realistic expectations, encouraging creativity and innovation, and prioritizing continuous learning and development.
