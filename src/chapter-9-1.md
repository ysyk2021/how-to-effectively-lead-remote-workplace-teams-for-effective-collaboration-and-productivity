As remote work becomes more prevalent, leaders must prioritize employee well-being to support the success of remote teams. This may include providing opportunities for social connection and promoting work-life balance.

Leaders must also consider the potential impact of remote work on employee mental health and take steps to provide support and resources as needed.
