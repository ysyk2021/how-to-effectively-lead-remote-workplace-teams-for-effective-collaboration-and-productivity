Remote workplace teams are groups of individuals who collaborate and work together on projects and initiatives, but are not physically co-located in the same office or workspace. Instead, remote workplace teams rely on technology and virtual communication tools to connect and collaborate with one another.

Remote workplace teams can take many forms and may include individuals from different departments, regions, or even countries. They may work on short-term or long-term projects, and may be composed of individuals with a variety of skills and backgrounds.
